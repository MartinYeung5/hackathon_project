## A. Current Problem
1. Every year, lots of expired cosmetic products have been delivered to landfill. It is really waste. But why?
Actually, expired cosmetic products can become useful product in our life!! Not rubbish.

## B. Solution
### collect > recycle > business product > profit > sustain whole project
Expired cosmetic product can become the color powder of watercolor / color pencil.
It maybe has some limitation of the color, but it can be used on different painting needs such as painting exercise, private painting course, school’s painting course and so on.

We creat the web3 platform to provide the service for different parties to achieve the "green purpose" together.

### Platform's function
1. User registration
2. User porfile
3. CMS for our partner: they can add the record for related action (add donation record/ transaction record) abd view report 
4. marketplace for business product
5. display project information
6. mint NFT (for our team admin)
7. send NFT (for partner)
8. event page

#### NFT Usage (application)
##### 1. Membership & Identity
* User can record the donation record, can recieve profit/color from our partners, can have further applicaiton related to other NFT project and metaverse.
* User can enjoy the benefit or service as the NFT owner
* image format (jpeg/png)
* image size (800 x 500) or similar size (maybe look like geneal name card/ membership card)
* will design 3 style for 3 types user 

#### Smart Contract (application)
##### 1. Donation record
##### 2. Make NFT

## C. Implementation
Develop an web3 platform with NFT application. 
Why?
I want to increase the motivation for public to join the platform and let the funding/ resource can be recorded more transparent. 
Also, I want the project can have more opportunities to connect different NFT projects and metaverse.

#### 8. Project Website
* can introduct our project

#### 9. Visual Report of data record
* we will use Oracle APEX to develop it

#### 10. Dummy data for database
* we need to test the application by lots of dummy data
* maybe 20 record (excel format) for one database and we will use this record in Oracle APEX application

### Technical points
1. using polygon network (low cost) ( 1 extra point)
2. using orale database for backup data and store sensitive info related to user ( 1 extra point)
3. using IPFS for NFT image storage ( 1 extra point) 
4. using solidy for blockahin smart contract

## D. Operation
### requirement
1. User need to have crypto wallet

### Role
### Donators (Collect products from donators): 
1.	Cosmetic manufacturers/ cosmetic shops can donate or sell the expired cosmetic products to our partners
2.	Public can donate or sell the expired cosmetic products to our partners. In order to increase the motivation, we will give them 1 NFT as identity reorganization/membership. Our partner can share their profit with them. It means that when Our partner get profit form the expired cosmetic products, the donator will receive the profit too.

#### Partners:
1.	Recycling company and NGO, expired cosmetic products and recycle to new product (color pencil or watercolor).
2.	Color pen manufacturers/ watercolor manufacturers, expired cosmetic products and recycle to new product (color pencil or watercolor)

#### User/Buyer:
1.School/painting school (Buyer), They can sign an agreement with our partners to have the long-term collaboration. Actually, every school may need lots of color consumption for painting class per year. 
2.Beneficiary Group (User) such as grassroots who may not have much money to buy color for painting or learning purpose, our partners can send some free color to them in order to support their learning or hobby. Our platform can record all resource allocation to prevent overuse.
3.Public (Buyer), they can buy business products via our platform.

### Connection between User and NFT
#### 1.	Public 
* When thay donated the expired cosmetic products to us, will receive 1 NFT for member record. 
* They can receive the profit when their expired cosmetic products can become business product and sold.
#### 2.	Beneficiary 
* When they receives the support from us, will receive 1 NFT for support record.
* We can record the support record in order to prevent the overuse of resource.
#### 3.	Partner 
* When thay support or collaborate with us to develop the project, will receive 1 NFT for partnership.
* For example, some people can help us to make the expired cosmetic products to become color pen. We can utilize NFT as partner identity and pay the fee for their work. All payment will be recorded on blockchain and let public to know the expense.

At the project’s beginning, we may need some funding for the project operation, but I believe we can sustain the project at future. 
Since we can develop the business product and receive some profit on it.

* Goal - 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
* Color pencil is consumables and i believe the factories have produced lots of color pencils every year, if we can have some substitute for traditional color pencil. it may be good for controlling the production.
