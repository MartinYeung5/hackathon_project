## Current Problem
1. Every year, lots of expired cosmetic products have been delivered to landfill. It is really waste. But why?
Actually, expired cosmetic products can become useful product in our life!! Not rubbish.

## Solution
### collect > reproduce > business product > profit > sustain whole project
1. Expired cosmetic product can become the color pen for general painting needs.
It maybe has some limitation of the color, but it can be used on different painting needs such as painting exercise, private painting course, school’s painting course and so on.
I think we can collect the suitable expired cosmetic products and make it to become color pen.

2.1. (charitable purpose) We can give the color pen to the group/region/organization who don’t have lots of money to buy color pen for painting course or painting event.

2.2. (business purpose) We can make the color pen as business product and sell it to the public. 
* I hope this can support the project’s expense and let the project can work sustainability.  
 
## Implementation
Develop an web3 platform with NFT application. 
Why?
I want to increase the motivation for public to join the platform and let the funding/ resource can be recorded more transparent. 
Also, I want the project can have more opportunities to connect different NFT projects and metaverse.

### Key development
1. web3 platform 
* User can record how many expired cosmetic products have been donated and check track their donation, 
if the donation (expired cosmetic products) become business product and sold, 
they will receive the profit too. 

2. NFT contract
* create NFT

3. Database design
* Store all data, we only store key data on blockchain.

4. Image design
* each NFT should have image cover

5. CMS
* For admin, they can access to the CMS and add the new record to the blockhain.

### Technical points
1. using polygon network (low cost) ( 1 extra point)
2. using orale database for backup data and store sensitive info related to user ( 1 extra point)
3. using IPFS for NFT image storage ( 1 extra point) 
4. using solidy for blockahin smart contract

## Operation
### requirement
1. User need to have crypto wallet

### User
1.	Public who has given the expired cosmetic products to us, will receive 1 NFT for member record. 
NFT function: Membership
They can receive the profit when their expired cosmetic products can become business product and sold.
2.	Beneficiary who receives the support from us, will receive 1 NFT for support record.
NFT function: record
we can record the support record in order to prevent the overuse of resource
3.	Partner who will support or collaborate with us to develop the project, will receive 1 NFT for partnership.
For example, some people can help us to make the expired cosmetic products to become color pen, 
we can utilize NFT as partner identity and pay the fee for their work. All payment will be recorded on blockchain and let public to know the expense.

At the project’s beginning, we may need some funding for the project operation, but I believe we can sustain the project at future. 
Since we can develop the business product and receive some profit on it.
